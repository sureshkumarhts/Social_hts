ActivePoll Plugin v1.0
======================

This plugin allows polls, integrated with your user model, within your application.

Install plugin
  * Run the following command:

  ./script/plugin install http://active-poll.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/active_poll

    This command will download the plugin code and run a script. The script will prompt you which is the name of the model you want to associate with a user vote (tipically the user model). . Otherwise, you just can press ENTER, telling the plugin that you don't want to assosiate a model, this way, the plugin would not be able to track which users made the votes for a particular poll.

  * Next, run the generator command (which generates model fields & migration files):

  ./script/generate active_poll

  * Update the database, populate the database with the ActivePoll tables: 

  rake db:migrate 

Create poll

  * To create a poll use the following command:

  ./script/runner vendor/plugins/active_poll/create_poll.rb

  The script will ask you which are the answers, which is the questions displayed, among other configurations (allows multiple selection, who is allowed to vote: registered users, anonymous, etc.) for the poll.

Show poll in views

   * Insert the active_poll helper in your view:

      #someview.rhtml (where you want to show the poll)
      ..
      <%= active_poll ( poll_name, { :in_place => true, :redirect_to => some_url, :view_dir => view_directory } ) %>
      ..

      Where:

          * poll_name. This is the name that identifies the poll to display. This is the only required parameter.
          * :in_place. Enables AJAX functionality to the poll if it is set to true, otherwise the hole page would be reload while submitting a vote.
          * :redirect_to. This is an url to redirect after the vote.
          * :view_dir. If present, it loads the poll pages (show_poll, already_vote, user_not_logged, etc) from the directory set by this parameter. Otherwise, all the active_poll pages would be take from the views directory inside the active_poll plugin's folder.

   * Insert act_as_vote_handler statement in the controller of the view (where the active_poll helper is used):

      class SomeController
        
         acts_as_vote_handler
        
        ..
      end
